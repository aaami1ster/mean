# Introduction To MEAN
# What is MEAN
MEAN is a Collections of javascript based technologies used to build fast, robust, and maintainable production web applications.
- __MongoDB__: Database System
- __Express__: Back-end Web Framework
- __Angular__: Front-end Framework
- __Node__   : Backend Runtime Environment

# Course Stategy
There are several MEAN stack boilerplates in existence, but this training doesn’t use any of them. 

It’s better to understand all the technologies independently rather than expect all applications to follow a single format.

# What willYou learn?
1. Build full stack applications in JavaScript using the MEAN technologies
1. Design and build RESTful APIs using Node.js, Express and MongoDB
    - Run Node on your local machine and download modules using npm. 
    - The key aspects of the Node.js programming model.
    - Express Middleware and Routes.
    - The integration of Node, Mongo, and Express.
1. Develop modular, maintainable Single Page Applications using Angular
    - Angular Architecture. 
    - Modules and components Data binding Directives Routing, and services.
1. Create and use MongoDB databases
    - Interact with Mongo from a Node application. 
    - Create, retrieve, update, and delete data from a Mongo store.
1. Architect MEAN stack applications from scratch.
